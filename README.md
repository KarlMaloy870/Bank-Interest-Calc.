# Bank-Interest-Calc.
This is code that will calculate a users balance for a savings account.

I made this for a school project and it is used to calculate a bank balance for a user based on time, interest percentage, and money deposited.

I feel that the presentation of the values to the user is something taht I believe that I did well.

I think the place I could improve was also where i felt my best work was. I think if I had more knowledge I could have made the output to the user be even more asthetically pleasing.

the most challenging code to me was getting each number to be output in a line with the correct spacing add itionally adding a "$" I used google and the website stackoverflow a lot inorder to learn how I could code it.


Again oddly enough the part of this project that was the most challenging also was where I learned the most and it transfered skills into other projects I had created.

I used multiple flies to make the code as manageable and readable as possible.
